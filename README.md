# PX4 Drone Autopilot

**This repo is a modified version for Multi-rotor with a feedforward term generated by a robotic arm**. The detail information could be seen in the latest commits by [zhangzp](https://cheungsiupaang.github.io/).

- This repo is applied as the underlying flight controller in two papers related to the motion planning for Aerial Manipulators, including an early-access published paper on [T-Mech](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10943237) and a pre-printed paper on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08338).

The original repo is directed to [PX4](https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot).
